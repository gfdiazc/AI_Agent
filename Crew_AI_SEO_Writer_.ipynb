I have made agents do everything from creating PowerPoint to video animations from images, gifs from videos, Word and Excel documents, and more. I even have agents who can research topics, reorganize and summarize the research, create a post, and post it on Twitter and Reddit.Given the right tools, agents can automate many sophisticated tasks. While I will admit they don’t always get it right, they are more than capable helpers. I wanted to demonstrate this by creating an agent that could automatically create a blog based on my writing, so I made a blog helper agent that does the following:1. Extract all the images, text, and code from a source Word document. In most cases, this is a chapter from one of my books.2. Compose a blog post given a rigid template.3. Generate a Word document for the post, including images and code.I then take the contents of the Word document, review it, and post it on Medium or wherever. To demonstrate the output of this agent I submit below a generated blog post from Chapter 8 from my book AI Agents In Action. This post is written in the style of Ernest Hemingway, which upon reflection may not be a good style for a technical article.The blog within the blog (AI generated from source)Artificial Intelligence is growing by leaps and bounds, like a young sapling straining towards the sun. One of its most exciting branches is the development of agentic systems — agents infused with memory and knowledge that can interact more naturally and effectively with us. Let’s delve into how retrieval plays a crucial role in making these systems tick.An image an AI generated to capture the essence of the blogIntroductionIn our ever-evolving world of AI,\n",

            "scalable and versatile AI systems.Creating a RAG workflow with LangChain involves several steps. First, documents are loaded and split into manageable chunks. These chunks are then transformed into vectors, typically using models like OpenAI embeddings. Finally, these vectors are stored in a database, ready to be queried for similarity search when needed.from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoaderfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader(\"sample_documents/mother_goose.html\")data = loader.load()text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=25, length_function=len, add_start_index=True,)documents = text_splitter.split_documents(data)LangChain documentationImplementing Memory in Agentic SystemsAgentic memory incorporates various forms — sensory, short-term, and long-term — to enrich interactions. Each type of memory enhances the AI’s capability to contextualize responses based on past interactions, making conversations more natural and meaningful.Sensory memory in AI processes immediate inputs like text, images, and audio, providing rapid but temporary contextual information. Short-term or working memory holds a limited amount of recent input, allowing the system to maintain context over the course of an interaction. Long-term memory stores more durable, relevant semantic and episodic memories which can be recalled over extended periods.Memory retrieval in AI systems follows a similar pattern to RAG but focuses more on the dynamic and evolving nature of accumulated information. By effectively categorizing and managing these different forms of memory, AI systems can simulate a more nuanced understanding, similar to human cognitive processes.Displaying the forms of memory and their relationship (AI Agents In Action)ConclusionThe journey through retrieval in agentic systems reveals a rich landscape where memory and knowledge intertwine.
